# simc-trinket-compare
Generates profiles to be appended to regular import on SIMC.

Instructions are on page, but the gist is add a trinket list, copy it, and put it at the bottom of your simc import, and comment out your existing trinkets.

Use the hosted version here:
https://dheighton.github.io/simc-trinket-compare/trinkets.html

Or
Download and run on your local computer, needs no extra code.

May be a lot easier/better, can do other gear compares too.
